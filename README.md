Narrowed Down Questions
1. How does the presidential election affect the general trend of the S&P 500 compared to the years surrounding it?
    This question is interesting because we want to know more about investing and when the market trends up.
2. How does the month of November react after the election? 
    This question is interesting because we want to know if easing political unrest increases performance for a time being.
3. What are the pre-election trends that are common in the months leading up to the election?
    We want to know if the campaign improves or digresses in the months prior to the election.
